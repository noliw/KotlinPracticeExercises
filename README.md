# Kotlin Practice Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Kotlin practice exercises that I completed to help learn and familiarize myself with the Kotlin programming language. The exercises were mostly taken from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), an online platform that offers coding challenges and kata exercises to help improve programming skills.

Each exercise is contained in its own file, named according to the exercise description. You can review the code for each exercise to see how the problem was solved.
